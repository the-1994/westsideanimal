           We offer comprehensive regular physical examinations that are customized to your pet’s particular needs. Immunization schedules are based on the most current research and individual risk factors for disease. We routinely test for the most common internal parasites and stress the need for adequate prevention of heartworms and intestinal parasites in all pets. As pets age, screening for the most common chronic diseases becomes an important part of the periodic wellness examination and consultation.

         Dr. Maia Broussard is currently Durham’s only Certified Veterinary Acupuncturist. She received training during 2009 and 2010, and completed her certification from the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society in the spring of 2010. Since that time she has been thrilled to add veterinary acupuncture to her toolbox for helping animals. We have had many pleased patients and clients! Because of her interest in pain management and rehabilitation, most of her patients have been pets with chronic pain and neurologic or orthopedic issues. However, as you can read below in the FAQs, acupuncture can be useful for many other problems. If your pet suffers from chronic discomfort or disability, or if you are interested in alternative therapies for problems such as kidney dysfunction, gastrointestinal upset, allergies, etc., please call for further information. <div class=""><a href="">Our Veterinary Dental Practice</a></div>
