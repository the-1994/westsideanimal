					<blockquote>"I was referred to Westside Animal Hospital when my older cat needed to have all his teeth removed.  I was nervous to go to another vet, but once I meet Dr. Hoover and his team, I felt reassured.  They were so great to both me and my cat.  They made this process easy and he is doing really good now.  Thanks Westside Animal Hospital for caring. "</blockquote>

					<blockquote>"We love Westside Animal Hospital, and have been bringing our cats there for over a decade.  Drs. Hoover and Broussard and all the staff are friendly, warm and take excellent care of our kitties--from the day we adopt them to the time we have to say good-bye.  I recommend them whenever I can.  Thanks, Westside."</blockquote>

					<li class="quote" id="content-4">
					<blockquote>"Excellent across the board. Over the last five years, I haven't met a single employee here who wasn't friendly, considerate, communicative, and kind. Both doctors are excellent, give great care and are animal-loving while being reasonable and realistic with owners--I have never felt pressured or guilted into any procedures, tests, or practices."</blockquote>
